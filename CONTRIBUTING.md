This document explains some of the guidelines around contributing to this project as well as how this project is structured, so you can jump in!

## Alignment first

We ask you that if you have an idea for a new feature you [open an issue](../../issues/new).

## Submitting your changes

For any change you make, we ask you to also **add corresponding unit tests**.

## How to contribute

### Structure of SwiftInspector

SwiftInspector is divided into three main parts:

#### SwiftInspector

Contains the main executable for this command line tool. It only contains the entry point `main.swift` file.

#### SwiftInspectorCommand

Contains all the files for managing commands and options for these commands. We can think of this as the *frontend* of this project.

#### SwiftInspectorCore

Is the *core* or *backend* of this project. In here is where the magic happens. You should put any file that's related to analyzing Swift code in here.

### Adding a new Command

To add a new command create a `YourCommand.swift` file inside `SwiftInspectorCommand`  and add it to the `InspectorCommand` subcommands. Your command should delegate to `SwiftInspectorCore` for all the logic related to analyzing Swift code.

### Adding new functionality

Since we want to separate the commands from the core functionality, you should abstract your core functionality in a class that lives in `SwiftInspectorCore`.
