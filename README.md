`SwiftInspector` is a command line tool and set of SPM libraries built on top of [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax). `SwiftInspector` reliably finds usages of classes, protocols, properties, etc. in a codebase by analyzing the Swift [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).
